Agile Alerts: A business tool for recruiters. 

## How it Works
Do you have a team of contractors and a list of jobs that need to get done?
Figuring out availability and scheduling is a costly and time-consuming task. 
Agile Alerts solves this problem with a bid notification service:
As soon as you post a new bid/job, your approved list of contractors will get text and email notifications. They can accept the job right away. 
It's a win-win: no more texting, emailing, and back-and-forth for either of you. Get your bids/jobs filled up super fast.
